GTUG Campout 2010 : HTML5 Hackathon Project
===========================================

Literally all we want to do is have fun with web sockets and do something cool.

We are not trying to solve a problem that has never been solved or do something
completely new. That is OK with us. We know that projects like Hummingbird already
exist and we are basically copying a lot of the same stuff. No biggie.

HTML5 rocks, exploit it.
